# Hand-Written-digit-recognition-project
 The Handwritten Digit Recognition project utilizes PyGame to create an interactive drawing canvas where users can sketch digits (0-9), which are then recognized using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images, each representing grayscale handwritten digits of size 28x28 pixels. The CNN model is structured with two convolutional layers (32 and 64 filters, 3×3 kernel), ReLU activations, max pooling (2×2), and fully connected layers, achieving an accuracy of ~99% on MNIST. The drawn digit is gray scaled, resized, and normalized before being fed into the model for prediction. The PyGame interface includes a drawing area, a clear button, and real-time prediction display. The project leverages Python, PyGame, TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV, and NumPy, ensuring efficient image processing and accurate classification. Future improvements may include multi-digit recognition, real-time feedback, and equation solving capabilities
